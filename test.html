In this code:

We set the max-width of the <iframe> to 100% to ensure it adjusts to the width of the browser window, making it responsive.

The height is set to auto, so the iframe's height adjusts proportionally to its width, maintaining the correct aspect ratio.

The frameborder attribute is set to "0" to remove the iframe's border.

This code will embed the WordPress blog into your webpage and make it fit within the browser window, including on mobile devices. However, please remember that users can still view the source code of your webpage to discover the embedded URL.
